# MyReads Project

This is the finished assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course done by student. I have created three componenets: BookShelf, Book, and Search.

## How to run

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Description

This project lets you brows books you have and search for more then add them to your three shelves: currently reading, to read, and read.
